"""
Variables are containers for storing data values.

Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable.

A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.



# memory - block [a -> 4]
# # variable = data;
# a = 2
# b = 4
# c = 4
# addition = 3 + 4
# subtraction = 4 - 3
# print(a)

"""
# int a; // declaration


# a = 3; // initilization
# b = 4;

# In Python, a = 4 -> declaration + initialization + memory asignment
# Q: is declaration available in Python? : No;

# [*] Python variables do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory space.

# name = "sanatan"
# age = 21
# work = True

# print("My name is " + name + " and my age is " + str(age) + " yes, I work.")
# print(work)
# True/False



# Multiple Assignment:
# a = 1
# b = 1
# c = 1
# a = b = c = 2
# a,b,c = 3,5,True
# print(a)
# print(b)
# print(c)


# 5 types of Python Data Type []
#  List   -> ADT
#  Tuples -> ADT
#  Numbers -> int, float, double, byte, long.
#  Strings
#  Dictionaries -> ADT

# ADT -> Abstract Data Type -> Abstraction is known as hiding the details. 


# string = "PYTHON"
# string[6] = "S"
# print(string)
# list = ["Sanatan", "Universe", "Universal Sanity"]  # List of strings



# append can only be supported in list (dynamic data types) -> Those who dont have fixed size.
