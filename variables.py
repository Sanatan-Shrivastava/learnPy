"""
Variables are containers for storing data values.

Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable.

A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.



# memory - block [a -> 4]
# # variable = data;
# a = 2
# b = 4
# c = 4
# addition = 3 + 4
# subtraction = 4 - 3
# print(a)

"""
# int a; // declaration


# a = 3; // initilization
# b = 4;

# In Python, a = 4 -> declaration + initialization + memory asignment
# Q: is declaration available in Python? : No;


# Code Katas - 3
# Q: Write a code to find the remiander of a where a = 14, and b = 2. Also print the values of a and b:

a = 14 
b = 2
remainder = a % b
print(remainder)
print(a)
print(b)
