# answer 1:

# example: 

# string_a = str(input("Enter your name:  "))
# list_string = []
# list_string = string_a.split(' ')
# print(list_string)



# answer 3:

#num = int(input())
#string_num = "5454" + str(num) 
#print(string_num)
#print(str.isalnum(string_num))
#ch = '4'
#print(string_num.count(ch))

# Character is denoted by '' / Strings can be denoted by either "" '' """""" ''''''
# character is reffered to single alphabet, num / Strings can be a sentence, groups of numbers
# character can be written in a single stroke from keyboard/ strings can be written in sngle storke.

# answer 5:

string_j = str(input("Please enter the string:  "))
print(string_j)
# do it again
ch_a = 'a'
ch_s = 's'
ch_d = 'd'
print(string_j.count(ch_a))
print(string_j.count(ch_s))
print(string_j.count(ch_d))

# DONE!!!!!
